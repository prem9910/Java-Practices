# Data Types in Java

In Java, data types specify the size and type of values that can be stored in variables. Java has two categories of data types: primitive data types and reference data types. This guide covers the different types of data types in Java, including their characteristics and usage.

## Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are the most basic data types in Java. They are predefined by the language and are directly supported by the Java programming language.

### Numeric Data Types

1. **`byte`:** 1 byte, -128 to 127
2. **`short`:** 2 bytes, -32,768 to 32,767
3. **`int`:** 4 bytes, -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
4. **`long`:** 8 bytes, -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
5. **`float`:** 4 bytes, 6-7 significant decimal digits
6. **`double`:** 8 bytes, 15 significant decimal digits

### Boolean Data Type

1. **`boolean`:** Represents true or false values, typically used for conditional statements.

### Character Data Type

1. **`char`:** 2 bytes, 0 to 65,535 (Unicode characters), represents a single character.

## Reference Data Types

Reference data types are objects in Java, which are created dynamically and can be of various types.

1. **`String`:** Represents a sequence of characters, used for storing text.
2. **Arrays:** Collections of similar type of elements, used for storing multiple values of the same data type.

1. **[Basic Data Type Assignment](Basics/Variables/BasicDataTypeAssignment.java):** Write a Java program to declare variables of all primitive data types and initialize them with appropriate values. Print the values of these variables.

## Usage

- Use primitive data types for simple values like integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and boolean values.
- Use reference data types when working with more complex data structures like strings, arrays, and objects.

## Conclusion

Understanding data types in Java is crucial for writing effective and efficient code. By choosing the appropriate data type for your variables, you can ensure proper memory allocation and efficient data manipulation in your Java programs.

Happy coding!
