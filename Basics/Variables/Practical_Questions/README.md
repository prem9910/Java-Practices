## Practical Questions on Primitive Data Types in JavaPractical Questions on Primitive Data Types in Java

1. **[Basic Data Type Assignment](BasicDataTypeAssignment.java):** Write a Java program to declare variables of all primitive data types and initialize them with appropriate values. Print the values of these variables.

2. **[Range Checking](RangeChecking.java):** Write a Java program to check and display the range of byte, short, int, and long data types using constants from the `java.lang` package.

3. **[Arithmetic Operations](ArithmeticOperations.java):** Write a Java program to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on variables of different primitive data types (int, float, double) and display the results.

4. **[Type Casting](TypeCasting.java):** Write a Java program to demonstrate type casting. Convert a double value to int, long, float, and byte, and print the results. Observe and explain any data loss.

5. **[Boolean Logic](BooleanLogic.java):** Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of boolean data type in conditional statements. Create a simple program that uses boolean variables in if-else conditions to print different messages.

6. **[Character Operations](CharacterOperations.java):** Write a Java program to demonstrate character operations. Initialize a char variable with a letter, increment its value, and print the next character in the alphabet.

7. **[Floating Point Precision](FloatingPointPrecision.java):** Write a Java program to show the difference in precision between float and double. Perform arithmetic operations with both types and print the results to see how precision differs.

8. **[Unicode Characters](UnicodeCharacters.java):** Write a Java program to print a set of Unicode characters. Initialize a char variable with different Unicode values and display the corresponding characters.

9. **[Default Values](DefaultValues.java):** Write a Java program to demonstrate the default values of primitive data types. Create a class with instance variables of each primitive type and print their default values without initializing them.

10. **[Temperature Conversion](TemperatureConversion.java):** Write a Java program that converts a given temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa using float or double data types for the temperature values.

11. **[Data Type Limits](DataTypeLimits.java):** Write a Java program that assigns the maximum and minimum values to byte, short, int, and long variables using constants from `java.lang.Integer`, `java.lang.Byte`, etc., and prints them.

12. **[Simple Calculator](SimpleCalculator.java):** Write a Java program to create a simple calculator that takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on them. Use int, float, or double as needed and print the results.
