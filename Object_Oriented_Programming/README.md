# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of objects. Java, as an object-oriented language, leverages OOP principles to create modular, reusable, and efficient code. Here are the four key concepts of OOP in Java:

## 1. Class and Object
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a datatype by bundling data and methods that work on the data into one single unit.
- **Object**: An instance of a class. It is created using the `new` keyword and can access the methods and attributes defined in the class.

## 2. Inheritance
- **Inheritance**: A mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behavior (methods) from an existing class. The new class is called a subclass, and the existing class is the superclass. This promotes code reuse.

## 3. Polymorphism
- **Polymorphism**: The ability of a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms. Method overriding and method overloading are two types of polymorphism in Java.

## 4. Encapsulation
- **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can be achieved using access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public`.

## 5. Abstraction
- **Abstraction**: The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

By applying these OOP principles, Java provides a robust framework for software development, allowing for better organization, scalability, and maintainability of code.
