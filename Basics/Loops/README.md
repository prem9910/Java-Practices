## Loops in Java

Java supports several types of loops for executing a block of code repeatedly. Loops are used to perform repetitive tasks in a program. They are essential for iterating over a set of values and perform operations on each element.

Java provides five types of loops:

1. **For Loop**: This loop is used when you want to execute a block of code a specific number of times. It is often used when you know the number of iterations in advance. [File Name: ForLoop.java](ForLoop.java)

2. **While Loop**: This loop is used when you want to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. It continues executing until the condition becomes false. [File Name: WhileLoop.java](WhileLoop.java)

3. **Do-While Loop**: Similar to the while loop, but the condition is checked after the block of code is executed. It ensures that the code block is executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false. [File Name: DoWhileLoop.java](DoWhileLoop.java)

4. **For-Each Loop**: This loop is used to iterate over the elements of a collection, such as an array or a list. It provides a cleaner and more readable way to iterate over elements. [File Name: ForEachLoop.java](ForEachLoop.java)

5. **For (Enhanced) Loop**: This loop is also known as the "for-each loop" and is used to iterate over the elements of an array or a collection. It provides a concise way to iterate over elements without explicitly using an index. [File Name: ForEnhance.java](ForEnhance.java)

Understanding and using loops effectively in Java can greatly simplify and enhance the readability of your code.
