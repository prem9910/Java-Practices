## Loops in Java

In Java, loops are used to iterate or repeat a block of code a specified number of times. Java provides several types of loops, each serving a different purpose. Here are the main types of loops in Java:

A for loop is used to execute a block of code a specified number of times. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement. The for loop is useful when you know the number of iterations in advance. Here's the syntax:
