## Practical Questions

### 1. [SwitchStatements.java](SwitchStatements.java)

#### Steps to solve the problem:

1. Get the number of the day from the user.
2. Use a switch statement to check the value of the day.
3. For each case, print the corresponding day of the week.
4. To demonstrate fall-through behavior, use a break statement after each case to stop the execution of the next case if the condition is met.

### 2. [NestedIfElse.java](NestedIfElse.java)

#### Steps to solve the problem:

1. Get the marks of the student from the user.
2. Use nested if-else statements to check the range of marks.
3. For each condition, print the corresponding grade of the student.
4. For example, if the marks are in the range of 90-100, print "A". If the marks are in the range of 80-89, print "B". And so on.

### 3. [TernaryOperator.java](TernaryOperator.java)

#### Steps to solve the problem:

1. Get two numbers from the user.
2. Use the ternary operator to compare the two numbers.
3. If the numbers are equal, print "Equal".
4. If one number is greater than the other, print "Greater".
5. If one number is lesser than the other, print "Lesser".
6. The ternary operator syntax is `(condition) ? (value if true) : (value if false)`.
