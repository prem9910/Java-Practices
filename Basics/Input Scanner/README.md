1. Create a class named Person with attributes name and age. Use Scanner to get user input for a name and age, then create a Person object and greet the user by name and age. 

2. Create a class named Rectangle with attributes length and breadth (or width) and methods to calculate and display the area. Use the Scanner class to get user input for the rectangle's dimensions. (Area of Rectangle = Length*Breadth) 

3. Create a class named Circle with an attribute radius and a method to calculate the area. Use Scanner to get user input for the circle's radius (Area of Circle = πr*r) 

4. Create a class name Calculator which will add, subtract, multiply and divide. 

5. Create a class to find out the distance b/w two coordinates. (d=√((x2 – x1)² + (y2 – y1)²).
