# Input { in JAVA}

There are **Four ways** by which we can take input from the console or from a files.

- **Command Line Arguments**: Passing arguments to a Java program through the command line.

- **Scanner Class**: A class that provides a way to read primitive types and strings from various sources such as keyboard input, files, and other input streams.

- **BufferedReader Class**: A class that extends the Reader class and provides buffering for reading input. It is commonly used for reading input from console.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A graphical way of interacting with a computer program. It provides a visual representation of the program's features and operations. Java provides several libraries for creating GUI applications such as Swing and JavaFX.

## Practice Tasks using Scanner

1. Create a class named Person with attributes name and age. Use Scanner to get user input for a name and age, then create a Person object and greet the user by name and age. 

2. Create a class named Rectangle with attributes length and breadth (or width) and methods to calculate and display the area. Use the Scanner class to get user input for the rectangle's dimensions. (Area of Rectangle = Length*Breadth) 

3. Create a class named Circle with an attribute radius and a method to calculate the area. Use Scanner to get user input for the circle's radius (Area of Circle = πr*r) 

4. Create a class name Calculator which will add, subtract, multiply and divide. 

5. Create a class to find out the distance b/w two coordinates. (d=√((x2 – x1)² + (y2 – y1)²).
