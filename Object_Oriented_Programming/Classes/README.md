# Java Classes and Objects Practice

This repository contains practical exercises and solutions for learning and understanding the concepts of classes and objects in Java. Each exercise is designed to help you practice and master the basics of Java programming.

## Questions and Solutions

### 1. Define a Simple Class and Create an Object
**Task**: Create a class `Car` with attributes `model`, `year`, and `color`. Define a method to display these details. Create an object of the `Car` class and call the method to display the car details.
- **File**: [BasicCarClass.java](BasicCarClass.java)

### 2. Constructor Usage
**Task**: Modify the `Car` class to include a constructor that initializes the `model`, `year`, and `color` attributes. Create an object using the constructor and display the car details.
- **File**: [CarConstructor.java](CarConstructor.java)

### 3. Getters and Setters
**Task**: Modify the `Car` class to include private attributes and provide public getter and setter methods for these attributes. Create an object, set its attributes, and display the details.
- **File**: [CarGettersSetters.java](CarGettersSetters.java)

### 4. Class with Multiple Methods
**Task**: Create a class `Rectangle` with attributes `length` and `width`. Define methods to calculate and return the area and perimeter of the rectangle. Create an object and display the area and perimeter.
- **File**: [RectangleMethods.java](RectangleMethods.java)

### 5. Static Members
**Task**: Create a class `Circle` with a static attribute `PI` and a non-static attribute `radius`. Define a method to calculate the area of the circle. Create objects and display the areas.
- **File**: [CircleStaticMembers.java](CircleStaticMembers.java)
