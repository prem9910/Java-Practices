# Conditional Statements in Java

Conditional statements in Java are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. They allow you to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on the result of a condition.

## Types of Conditional Statements

Java supports three types of conditional statements:

1. **If Statement**: Used when there is only one condition to check.

2. **If-Else Statement**: Used when there are two possible outcomes based on a condition.

3. **Nested If Statements**: Used when there are multiple conditions to check.

4. **Switch Statement**: Used when you have multiple conditions to check and execute different blocks of code based on the result of a single expression.
